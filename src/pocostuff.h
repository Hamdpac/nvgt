// Not sure if this should be in another header, if I use this for more than Poco I may consider it. I'm so tired of trying to decide whether to register angelscript types as value or reference. I'm always turned away from reference types because well, the classes I want to wrap have no reference counter. Look maybe this could have been done with c++ multiple inheritance or something, but my brain is tired of learning new concepts for the moment and so hopefully this is portable enough to make better later. Following are methods for attaching a reference counter to any class for registration with angelscript as a reference type.
struct angelscript_refcounted {
	int refcount;
	int magic; // Verification encase a pointer of the objects type tries to get passed to the script, if this value doesn't match in memory we can return null or something, or even better create one of these structures so that the object could be supported?
};
template <class T> inline void* angelscript_refcounted_create() {
	angelscript_refcounted* rc = (angelscript_refcounted*) malloc(sizeof(angelscript_refcounted) + sizeof(T)); // We don't use the new operator here because we don't want the constructor of the containing object to fire until the user's factory function.
	rc->refcount = 1;
	rc->magic = 0x1234abcd;
	return (char*)rc + sizeof(angelscript_refcounted);
}
inline angelscript_refcounted* angelscript_refcounted_get(void* obj) {
	angelscript_refcounted* rc = reinterpret_cast<angelscript_refcounted*>((char*)obj - sizeof(angelscript_refcounted));
	if (rc->magic != 0x1234abcd) return NULL; // This pointer didn't originate from our factory.
	return rc;
}

	if (asAtomicDec(rc->refcount) < 1) {
		obj->~T(); // Since we created the refcounted structure with malloc in order to manually call object's constructor, we need to manually call the destructor as well.
