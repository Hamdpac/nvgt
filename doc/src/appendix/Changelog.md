# Changelog
This document lists all major changes that have taken place in NVGT since we started keeping track.

## New in 0.85.1-beta (06/03/2024):
* The restart method on timers will now unpause them.
* Dramatically increase the speed of floating point string parsing.
* The form and speech includes no longer require  bgt_compat!
* adds sound_default_pack property.
    * For example, you can now create a pack object, execute the expression @sound_default_pack = my_pack; and from that point all sounds in the engine will use the default pack you have set unless you explicitly override it.
* Modified number conversion in sound mixer classes to use more efficient string -> number handling
* Fixed typo in doc for BSL license
* Start on the documentation for the pack object
* include form.nvgt in the speech.nvgt include by default.
* Add includes/number_speaker.nvgt (a port of bgt's class); makes it very easy to self-voice numbers!
* There are now a few more test cases as well as the beginnings of a benchmarking framework which will begin leading to several speed improvements such as the floating point processor mentioned above!

## New as of 05/31/2024:
* complete rewrite of NVGT entry point to use a Poco application. This includes much cleanup and organization and adds several features:
    * There is now proper command line parsing, help printing, config file loading for when we want to use it, and more.
    * This also introduces the change that on windows, there is now nvgt.exe and nvgtw.exe that gets built, one with the windows subsystem and one without.
    * Script files and nvgt's binary will check for config files with the basename of file + .ini, .properties, or .json.
* The above changes mean that we now implement the Angelscript debugger since the nvgt compiler is now always available in console mode.
* NVGT now uses simantic versioning, for example 0.85.0.
* Fixed script return code.
* NVGT finally has a cross-platform installer (NSIS on Windows and a .dmg file on macOS).
* The timer class once present in `bgt_compat.nvgt` is finally in the core of the engine!
* it is now possible to embed packs into executables! 
* The way Windows binaries load has been changed, meaning that UPX or any other binary compresser that supports overlays can now be used on your compiled NVGT binaries!
* The timer resolution should be much more accurate on Windows.
* Added a new, optional `uint timeout` parameter to the `network.request()` method.
* Improved documentation.

## New as of 05/25/2024:
* Wrapped `thread_pool` and `thread_event` from Poco.
* New function: `script_engine_dump_configuration()`.
* We now have an ftp_client class.
* raw memory allocation functions and memory_reader/writer datastreams to use them.
* May need more testing, but added the `async` class, for easily running a function on a thread and getting its return value.
* Many more docs.

## New as of 05/08/2024:
* Added a plugin to send notifications to systemd on Linux.
* Many more docs.
* `string.split()` should now reserve memory properly.
* Wrapped Poco for HTTP/HTTPS requests.
* Fix ancient bugs in soundsystem including too many functions registered as const and `close()` returning true on no-op.

## New as of 04/18/2024:
* The var type now has PostEnc and PostDec operators.
* UTF8 fixes: sound.load, and compiled applications can now execute if they contain non-english characters in their filenames.
* All code that I wish to share has been forked into what will hopefully be nvgt's long-standing repository which will eventually have it's privacy status switched to public!
* NVGT now has a build system! I know it's not the fastest one around, but needing a  middleground between learning even more new things and using what I already know, I chose SCons purely because of the fermiliar pythonic environment and not needing to learn yet another new set of syntax rules. I'm just glad we're no longer building the engine using a series of shell scripts!
* Added basic steam audio reverb integration! It needs a lot of work and is far from being production ready (seriously this could slow your game to a crawl until I'm done with this), but nevertheless it is still around for testing!

## New leading up to 02/20/2024:
* NVGT now finally has a documentation structure!
* Unifying the file object into stream classes.

## New as of 01/06/2024:
* Misc sound system improvements (including the ability to set the pitch of a sound as low as 5).
* Fix memory leak.
* Remove sound_environment class for now.
* Should load bassflac.dll and bassopus.dll if present
* JSON Support.
* Better multithreading support with more primatives.
* More functions in the string class.
* New methods of operating system detection.
* Instance class removed from engine and replaced with include/instance.nvgt which wraps a named_mutex.
* Regular expressions now use PCRE2 via poco including lower level regexp class.
* Alert and question now use SDL message boxes (not sure what I think of this).
* Other misc changes.

## Note for changes before 01/06/2024:
Changes were roughly untracked before this time, but there is a rather large list of somewhat sorted changes below as commited to nvgt_bin (a repository where the NVGT testers could access and test NVGT). These are sorted by month where possible to make them easier to sort, but keep in mind that commits to nvgt_bin usually occurred all at once so that building NVGT was easier for all platforms. As such, expect these lists (while somewhat sorted) to become rather large! Additionally, some of these changes may be ambiguous due to being based off of nvgt_bin's commit messages only. At this time, it was assumed anyone using this engine had direct contact with Sam to ask questions.
